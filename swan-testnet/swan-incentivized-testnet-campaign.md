# Swan Testnet Campaign

We are thrilled to announce the launch of Swan Testnet's incentivized campaign! Running from **November 20th**, Be part of shaping Swan's future as an open marketplace for cloud resources.&#x20;

Calling all Web3 developers, crypto enthusiasts, and service providers to explore Swan Testnet's key features and sharing feedback. A total of **150,000 SWAN** awaits contributors—let's drive innovation together!

**Campaign Duration: November 20th, 2023, 00:00 (EST) - December 20th, 2023, 23:59 (EST)**

## Missions:

Swan Testnet aims to build an open and decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources, powered by the Optimism Network. By incentivizing participation from computing providers worldwide, Swan seeks to expand access to GPU power for AI/ML projects and dApp deployment.

The testnet campaign provides an opportunity to demonstrate Swan's capabilities, gather feedback, and drive adoption by rewarding providers. This milestone represents a major step towards realizing the vision of an efficient, open marketplace for cloud computing.

## Goals:

* Onboard 100 new computing providers to the Swan testnet to expand geographic coverage and computing capacity
* Achieve over 1,000 GPUs contributed across computing providers to provide robust AI and dApp infrastructure
* Enable over $100,000 worth of computing transactions on the testnet for stability testing of multichain payment channels.
* Support the deployment of at least 1,000 Spaces on the Swan network
* Form strategic partnerships with 5 AI/ML projects to demonstrate Swan's ability to power cutting edge innovation
* Gather feedback from 30+ Computing Providers to help inform the roadmap and mainnet launch
* Distribute allocated SWAN rewards to incentivize providers and drive participation
* Document key learnings, challenges, and successes throughout the testnet launch to aid the transition to mainnet

## Event 1: Contribution Rewards

All qualified Computing Providers (CPs) joining the Swan Network and contributing GPU resources on the testnet are entitled to a base bonus of **50 SWAN**. Moreover, they have the chance to share a prize pool (at least **50,000 SWAN**)  based on their contributions to the Swan Network during the campaign.&#x20;

To participate, follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/lagrange-dao/computing) in the Documentation to deploy a Computing Provider, and check the [Dashboard](https://provider.lagrangedao.org/provider-status) to confirm if the Computing Provider is running.

#### How to be Eligible:

* Eligible CPs must have at least one Space deployed and running during the campaign.
* Maintain a provider uptime exceeding 90%.
* Submission of the[ form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.

#### Rewards:

* All eligible Computing Providers receive a base bonus of **50 SWAN**.
* Eligible Computing Providers share the Prize Pool (at least **50,000 SWAN**) based on their contributions, including the amount of space deployed, GPU usage duration, and CP uptime.
* All unspent SWAN budget from other events will be transferred into the prize pool.

## Event 2: Universal Basic Income (UBI) Trial Rewards:

Every eligible Computing Provider (CP) in the Swan Network has the opportunity to participate in the UBI Trial Rewards program. This program is designed to ensure fair compensation for network providers, even during periods of inactivity when there might be fewer tasks from Space Builders.

#### How to be Eligible:

* Eligible CPs must have at least one Space deployed and running during the campaign.
* Maintain a provider uptime exceeding 90%.

#### Rewards:

* Eligible Computing Providers share the prize pool of up to **50,000 SWAN**.
* Unspent SWAN budget will be transferred into the prize pool of the Event 1: Contribution Rewards.

## Event 3: Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program:

The Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program offers an additional **600 SWAN** tokens to CPs from cities and countries without a representative CP on the testnet.

#### How to be Eligible:

* Set up a CP from a city or country outside specific regions (the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Finland, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia and any country already has CPs).
* Have at least one GPU space running during the campaign.
* Maintain provider uptime exceeding 90%.
* Submission of the[ form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.

#### Rewards:

* Computing Providers from regions without a representative CP on the testnet can earn an additional reward of **600 SWAN**.

## Event 4: Referral Rewards:

Swan encourages existing CPs to refer new qualified CPs to the Network, offering a referral reward of **300 SWAN** tokens for each successful referral.

#### How to be Eligible:

* The referee CP must have at least one GPU space running during the campaign.
* The referee CP must maintain uptime exceeding 90%.
* Submission of the[ form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.
